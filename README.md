# Blade Clone - Card Game

This is a React implementation of a card game called "Blade Clone".

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.0.0 or higher recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required dependencies:

```bash
